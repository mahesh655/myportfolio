        <strong>Project Overview:</strong><br>
        In this project, I utilized MySQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization to analyze insurance policy data. The aim was to gain insights into insured values, yearly premiums, and the impact of natural disasters on different business types and construction methods.

        <strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong><br>
        <strong>Database:</strong> MySQL<br>
        <strong>Visualization:</strong> Power BI
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Key Insights and Features:</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sum of Insured Value by Business Type:</strong> This line chart shows the total insured value for various business types, helping identify sectors with the highest and lowest coverage. <em>Insight:</em> Sectors like Apartments and Offices have the highest insured values, while Retail has the lowest.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Yearly Premium by Business Type:</strong> This bar chart illustrates the average yearly premium for each business type. <em>Insight:</em> Business types like Construction and Apartments have higher average premiums, indicating a higher risk or higher coverage amounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Count of Policies by Risk Rating and Description:</strong> A pie chart displaying the distribution of policies based on risk ratings. <em>Insight:</em> Most policies fall under risk rating A0, suggesting that the majority are considered low-risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact of Natural Disasters by Construction Type:</strong> A table summarizing the number of policies affected by floods and earthquakes for each construction type. <em>Insight:</em> Frame construction is the most affected by natural disasters, while Fire Resist construction is the least affected.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Count and Goal Tracking:</strong> A card visual showing the total count of policies and progress towards set goals. <em>Insight:</em> Helps track the performance and targets in policy issuance.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Time Travel for Data Analysis:</strong> An interactive time slider to filter data based on specific date ranges, regions, and locations. <em>Insight:</em> Allows for dynamic data analysis and trend observation over time.</li>
        </ul>
